In order to run the program do the following steps:
1) Place dcr graph(s) into the "Patterns" folder. Use the XML format. A DCR graph can be exported to
     XML using the tool on dcrgraphs.net

2) Place the log file in the main folder. This needs to be csv format and must have at least the 
    headers "ID" and "EventName", that are the trace ID and event name respectively. Also make sure, 
    that the events in the log and the events in the dcr graphs are the same, since the 
    implementation is case sensitive. The csv file also needs to have delimiter ";".

3) Run the project, by writing "dotnet run" in the terminal.
